#### Briefly About Myself:
 I have started programming when I was 17 years old and studied at the university. My first programs was written on C++ and Java as a console apps 
 .In that time I have tried a lot of algorithms and knew about different data structures. But the greatest programming experience I have got on Python. 
 I have created full-fledged site using Django 3.2. Of course, I needed to be frontend-end, back-end , and QA at the same time, eventually I achieved this challenge. 
After a multifaceted project, I realized that I wanted to be a front-end developer. I am sure that I am able to take this position.
